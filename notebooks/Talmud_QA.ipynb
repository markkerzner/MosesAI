This applies, however, to saying Shema while looking at his wife, looking at her hair, or listening to her singing. Rabbi Chanina said, \"I saw that during his Standing prayer Rabbi Yehudah the Prince belched, yawned, sneezed, and spat upon the ground.\" How was he allowed to do this? - Belching and yawning are indeed allowed if done involuntarily, provided that when yawning one covers his mouth. Sneezing - if it is a euphemism for passing wind, then indeed it is not allowed, but sneezing with one\\'s nose is actually a good sign: just as he got relief in this world, so he will get relief in the next one.

       "   'chunk_text': 'Brachot 2 - Saying the Shema Prayer Twice a day, evening and morning, one must say that he will listen to God and love God. This is the Shema prayer, \"Listen, Israel, God is our Lord, God is One.\" Since the Torah continues, \"when you lie down and when you get up,\" we understand that this paragraph needs to be said twice. However, the Shema is not said when one actually goes to sleep or wakes up, but rather in the general period when people lie down and get up. When is this? In the evening - when the Kohanim, who were impure, are returning from the mikveh to eat priestly portion (terumah), that is, at nightfall. That is when the time to say the Shema in the evening begins, but when does it end? Rabbi Eliezer said, \"Until the end of the first watch, that is, the first part of the night.\" Rabbi Eliezer understands \"when you lie down\" as the time when people go to sleep. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. We can understand Rabban Gamliel, \\'when people lie down\" means when people are asleep. But the opinion of the Sages will require clarification. Why did the teacher not state simply, \"nightfall,\" and instead talked about Kohanim coming home? - Because he wanted to teach an additional rule in passing, that the Kohanim can start eating their portion at night, after immersion. That is true even if they had a severe impurity, such as that of a zav, and still, need to bring a sacrifice - that offering does not prevent them from eating their kohen\\'s portion.

       "   'chunk_text': 'Brachot 15 - Proper Way Rabbi Yochanan taught: \"One who wishes to accept on himself Heaven\\'s sovereignty in a complete manner, should relieve himself and wash his hands, don tefillin, then say the Shema, and the Amidah (Standing) prayer - and this is complete acceptance.\" If one said the Shema, but did not make it audible to his ears - this not the perfect way, but it counts. Rabbi Yose disagrees and says that he has not fulfilled his obligation and will have to repeat the Shema. What is the argument? Rabbi Yose says that the word \"Shema\" itself, which means \"Hear\" teaches that one should hear his words. And the first teacher (usually it is Rabbi Meir), what does he say? He says, \"Shema,\" or \"Hear\" means \"Understand\" and tells us that one can say the Shema in any language that he understands. And Rabbi Yose? He surelly agrees that one can say the Shema in any language!? - He says that the word \"Shema\" actually carries both lessons: that one must hear his words and that one can recite the Shema in any language that he understands.

Rav Chisda answered him, \"My God! Even if Rabbi Yochanan himself told me this, I would not listen to him.\" Rather he should pause. If he did not, the verse from Ezekiel applies to him, \"I (God) too gave you decrees that were not good\" - since he denied the goodness contained in Shema. If he did stop, however, his reward is in the verse \"And with this matter (or speech) shall you prolong your days.\" If one\\'s hand is resting in the airspace of a latrine, can he say the Shema then? Rav Huna says that he is permitted, relying on the verse in the psalms, \"All that breathe shall praise God\" - that is, only the position of his nose and mouth matters. However Rav Chisda forbids it, based on a different verse, \"All my limbs shall exclaim, \\'God, who is like You!\\'\" Art: David The Younger Teniers - The Five Senses Series- Smelling Talk to MosesAI about it'}},\n",

       "   'chunk_text': 'Brachot 5 - Prayer Shema at Bedtime Even though one says the Shema in the synagogue during the evening prayer, it is still a mitzvah to recite it again before going to sleep. Why? The psalm says, \"Reflect in your hearts while on your beds, and then be silent.\" Resh Lakish sees another lesson here: a man should constantly agitate his good thoughts against the bad ones (\"Agitate and don\\'t sin\"); if he removes the bad, good, but if not - let him study Torah (\"reflect in your hearts\"); if he wins, good, if not - let him say the Shema (\"on your beds\"); if that does not help, he should remind himself of the day of death (\"be silent\"). Rabbi Zeira said, \"Look how the Holy One Blessed Be He is not like a person of flesh and blood. If a person sells a cherished object to another, he is sad, and the buyer is happy. But the Holy One Blessed Be He gave the Torah to Israel, and He rejoiced, saying \\'For I have given you a good doctrine, do not abandon My Torah.\\'\" If a person sees afflictions befalling him, he should investigate his deeds since the nature of the distress may have a hint for him. If he examined his deeds and did not find anything, he should attribute it to the neglect of Torah study, based on the phrase \"Fortunate is the man whom God afflicts, and whom You teach from Your Torah.\" If he did not find that either, they are \"afflictions of love,\" since \"For God rebukes the one He loves.\" Art: Cornelis Bisschop - Old Woman Sleeping Talk to MosesAI about it'}},\n",

       "   'chunk_text': 'Brachot 24 - Saying Shema in the presence of nakedness If two people are sleeping in one bed, and their buttocks are touching, can each turn his face away from the other and recite Shema? Some say that it is permitted, and even when the other person is his wife. Others say that, just the opposite, only with his wife it is permitted, because he and his wife are considered as one flesh, but with others it would not be allowed. However, one should not say the Shema while looking at any part of a woman\\'s body that is normally covered, and now happens to be uncovered. When does this apply? It goes without saying that one cannot enjoy a woman\\'s beauty if she is not his wife, and looking at any part of her for his gratification is forbidden. This applies, however, to saying Shema while looking at his wife, looking at her hair, or listening to her singing. Rabbi Chanina said, \"I saw that during his Standing prayer Rabbi Yehudah the Prince belched, yawned, sneezed, and spat upon the ground.\" How was he allowed to do this? - Belching and yawning are indeed allowed if done involuntarily, provided that when yawning one covers his mouth. Sneezing - if it is a euphemism for passing wind, then indeed it is not allowed, but sneezing with one\\'s nose is actually a good sign: just as he got relief in this world, so he will get relief in the next one. Spitting is allowed if it bothers him and he does not have napkin, and even then, he should spit to the back of himself, and pause after it.

This is the Shema prayer, \"Listen, Israel, God is our Lord, God is One.\" Since the Torah continues, \"when you lie down and when you get up,\" we understand that this paragraph needs to be said twice. However, the Shema is not said when one actually goes to sleep or wakes up, but rather in the general period when people lie down and get up. When is this? In the evening - when the Kohanim, who were impure, are returning from the mikveh to eat priestly portion (terumah), that is, at nightfall. That is when the time to say the Shema in the evening begins, but when does it end? Rabbi Eliezer said, \"Until the end of the first watch, that is, the first part of the night.\" Rabbi Eliezer understands \"when you lie down\" as the time when people go to sleep. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. We can understand Rabban Gamliel, \\'when people lie down\" means when people are asleep. But the opinion of the Sages will require clarification. Why did the teacher not state simply, \"nightfall,\" and instead talked about Kohanim coming home? - Because he wanted to teach an additional rule in passing, that the Kohanim can start eating their portion at night, after immersion. That is true even if they had a severe impurity, such as that of a zav, and still, need to bring a sacrifice - that offering does not prevent them from eating their kohen\\'s portion.

Rav Chisda answered him, \"My God! Even if Rabbi Yochanan himself told me this, I would not listen to him.\" Rather he should pause.

But the Holy One Blessed Be He gave the Torah to Israel, and He rejoiced, saying \\'For I have given you a good doctrine, do not abandon My Torah.\\'\" If a person sees afflictions befalling him, he should investigate his deeds since the nature of the distress may have a hint for him.

However, it also mentions going out of Egypt, and for this reason Ben Zoma maitains that one should say it, even in the evening recitation of Shema, because the Torah required to \"remember Exodus all the days of your life.\" \"Days\" means just that, days, but \"all days\" includes nights. However, the Sages say that it is not necessary to mentions Exodus at night. How do they explain the word \"all?\" - To include the Messianic era. Ben Zoma then questioned the Sages, \"But the Exodus troubles will be forgotten in the Messianic time!?\" The Sages answered him, \"Not forgotten entirely, but only relegated to the second place, in view of the new miracles that will happen then.\" If one happened to be reading the \"Shema\" - \"Listen, Israel\" in the Torah, at exactly the moment when the time to read this as a prayer arrived, does it count for him as prayer, or will he have to read it again? - That depends. If he had in mind, it counts, and if not, it does not. Does this mean in general that one has to be conscious of his doing a mitzvah, and only then it counts? - Not necessarily. Perhaps \"having it in mind\" does not mean \"to fulfill his prayer obligation\" but simply means that he is conscious that he is saying the words.
